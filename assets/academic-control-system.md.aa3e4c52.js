I was the technical leader and I worked on it for 3 years. Its objective is automate/modernize all the academic related processes of the university.</p><p>We started the project from scratch and since I was the technical leader, I was free to choose the technologies for this project so I decided to go for Laravel, Vue.js and MySQL since they were the technologies that I mastered, they were suitable for the project and my team had knowledge with PHP, Javascript and MySQL so I just needed to teach them about the frameworks.
